## Open Questions:
	- CountryProcessor: 
		- Issue: His requirement "in all cases, before printing, collect the result into a java collection local variable"
		Q: Can .max and .min with "Optional<>" be categorized as "collecting"? 
		
		- Issue: printAllCapitalsThatContainLetterIntoASingleStringNoSpaces lists countries in its example. 
		Q: Is the example inaccurate? Should we go with capitals or with countries?
	- Design Patterns and Concurrency:
		- Issue: Both of these parts in the assignment were too easy. 
		Q: Did I misinterpret the task? When he says "implement" I assumed he wants us to put it into effect. Is he expecting us to change their purpose of the examples in any way?
