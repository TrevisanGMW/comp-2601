Look at the code from the GUI we built in class.

Build a GUI-based application that does the following:

- reads a CSV file named cars into a list
- the Car class gets its data from the csv file:
- make (String), model (String), year (int), electric (boolean)
- make sure there are 30 cars in the csv file
- make a GUI application like today, where you can search by (a) make or model (e.g. if a car is "Ford Mustang" then it should be found by searching for "for" or "ford" or MUStaNG" or even "rd mu", or by year, or by whether its electric.
- make sure the jlist is cleared with each new search
