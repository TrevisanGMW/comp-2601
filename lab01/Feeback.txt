Review Lab01:
No variables with number names or javadocs
isBlank (checks if empty)
Use primitives instead of wrapper classes
No data type in javadocs
No need for else, check for errors THEN store the data
He likes declare, then initialise (separated)
Shouldn’t declare strings as “”, null instead
Unit tests should be hard-coded
Should be at the top line, keep it up and then move the rest of the line down
Always remove unused imports or functions (@Before, @After)
Don’t mention numbers in javadoc or errors (even if referenced)

Declare as a list then instantiate as list type? List -> ArrayList
